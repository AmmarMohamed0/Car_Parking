# Parking Car Detection with YOLOv5

This repository contains code to detect cars within a specified parking area in a video using YOLOv5 object detection model. It utilizes the Ultralytics YOLOv5 implementation and OpenCV library for processing and visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- YOLOv5 (pretrained weights)
- GPU (recommended for faster inference)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmmarMohamed0/Car_Parking.git
